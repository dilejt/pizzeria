## General info
A pizzeria web application, allowing you to choose a pizza from the available menu. Each individual order can be further customized by modifying the size of the chosen pizza and extras. After approving your choices the order is placed in the shopping cart where you can change its quantity or remove it, dynamically modifying the total price in that way. All available pizzas and extras are saved in JSON files.
